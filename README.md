## Chess App (work in progress)

A chess app using a minimax algorithm (not yet completed). The only dependencies are Lit (a lightweight framework for making web components), and chess.js for chess move validation.

## Quick Start

Ensure node and npm are installed on your machine. Clone the repository and install the necessary packages, by running the following in the root directory:

```bash
npm i 
```

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

The project will be available at `localhost:8000`.
