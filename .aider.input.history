+I'd like my chess app to have a darker background on the squares where a piece can move to. This should happen when a piece / square is hovered over, and when the piece is being dragged. This should be done using custom events, which can be created in the eventtypes file

+It still only works when the piece is dragged, not hovered over. This shouldn't be difficult. The chess piece can emit an event when it is hovered over. The event can contain the id of the square. Then, the chessapp element can pass this down to the controller, which calls _game.moves() to get an array of available moves. Then, this lsit can be passed down to the chess board, which sets a property on the chess square if that square is in the array of available moves

+Currently, the dragover and drop event listeners are in the ChessSquare. I'd like to handle dragover and drop outside of the ChessBoard, for example, to clear the highlighted squares when the piece is dragged and dropped outside the board. Howevrr, it's perhaps bad practice to have dragover and drop event listeners added to the document by the chessboard, and to each square by the square itself. I'd like this all to be handled in one component, ideally the chessboard.

+/ask My drag and drop isn't working properly. If possible, I'd like my dragstart handler to be in chessboard to prevent the need for a separate event to be emitted from the chesspiece when dragging starts. However, the e.target in the dragstart event is the chesssquare, not the chesspiece. Why is this?

# 2025-04-20 03:04:18.142113
+That's great. However, the cloning of the piece element for the drag image no longer works. Why not? It worked when the draggable="true" was placed on the div in the chesspiece, and the dragstart event was intercepted in chesssquare, not chessboard

# 2025-04-20 17:36:38.944642
+I would like to change my ChessPiece files (e.g. KingPieceIcon and KnightPieceIcon) to take in a size parameter. The PieceIconFactory can set this size on the pieces upon instantiation of the piece. The render function in each PieceIcon will need to be changed to use the size paramter and set that as the height and width attributes in the svg tag.

+Perhaps you misunderstand. White wants to minimise, whereas black wants to maximise. Therefore, it follows that the order is correct to penalise draws more than checkmates for both sides. Surely having the same negative value for both sides wouldn't work, as it would benefit one side and harm the other. Also, I don't understand your point about the AI not looking ahead due to relying on depth. Surely, when it comes to the point of the last move being made in the repitition sequence, the end of the node in the tree would return an unfasvourable result for any moves that would result in the draw not being taken. This would perhaps only apply after the first two moves have actually taken place, and not through the third iteration trhough the minimax function

+/ask I discovered what the issue is. Since the MinimaxWorker.getBestMove() cannot be passed a Chess object, a new one has to be instantiated, which doesn't have the history of the object being used in the ChessGameController. Therefore, I need to find a way of passing the original Chess object (from Chess.js) to the MinimaxWorker.getBestMove(), or for the newly instantiated object to have the history of the original one. Is this possible?

+It still doesn't work. The dialog styles should be a function that is called. That way, whenever the dialog renders, the function is called (an arrow function in chessapp) so that the correct styles are returned based on the dark mode attribute in chessapp
